Love to learn new things and stay up to date on the newest tech. I recently completed a 9-month data science boot camp at TripleTen and I am very excited to embark on this new career path. My skills include data analytics, data visualization, Python, JavaScript, SQL, and various types of ML(supervised & unsupervised). I have prior experience as a process & controls engineer and a manufacturing systems engineer in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Both positions required attention to detail, learning new programming languages, excellent time management, and constant communication with internal and external stakeholders.

âš¡ Fun facts:
- Originally from Lebanon, will never say no to hummus & tabbouleh
- Swimming, kayaking, and running keep me sane
- Fan of real estate investing and have two rental properties
- Enjoy watching documentaries that offer new perspectives/learning
